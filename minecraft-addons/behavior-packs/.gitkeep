# Behavior Packs

Place your Minecraft Bedrock behavior pack `.mcpack` files here.

Behavior packs contain:
- Game logic
- Entity behaviors
- Item definitions
- Block behaviors
- Scripts

## Example

```
behavior-packs/
├── my-gameplay-mod.mcpack
└── custom-entities.mcpack
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically detect and deploy these packs to your realm.
