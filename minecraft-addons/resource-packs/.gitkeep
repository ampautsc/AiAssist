# Resource Packs

Place your Minecraft Bedrock resource pack `.mcpack` files here.

Resource packs contain:
- Textures
- Models
- Sounds
- UI elements
- Particles

## Example

```
resource-packs/
├── my-texture-pack.mcpack
└── cool-ui-pack.mcpack
```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically detect and deploy these packs to your realm.
