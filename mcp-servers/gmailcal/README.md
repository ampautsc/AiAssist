This server enhances Claude's email and calendar management capabilities with specialized prompts for email analysis, summarization, task extraction, meeting detection, contact extraction, prioritization, and more.

## ⚙️ How to Use

To utilize the Gmail MCP Server, follow these steps:

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project and Enable the Gmail API
- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
- Create a new project.
- Enable the Gmail API.
- Create OAuth2 credentials (Client ID & Client Secret).
- Configure the OAuth consent screen and add necessary scopes.

### 2. Get a Refresh Token
To obtain a refresh token:
- Use the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.
- Request access to the necessary API scopes:
  - For Gmail: `https://mail.google.com/`
  - For Calendar (read-only): `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
  - For Calendar (read/write): `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
  - For Contacts: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly`
- You can either:
  - Run the included auth flow using `cargo run -- auth` which will request all required scopes
  - Utilize the [Google OAuth 2.0 Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/) for token generation

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In the same directory as the executable, create a `.env` file with:
```
GMAIL_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
```

### 4. Build and Run the MCP Server
To compile and run the server, execute:
```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/mcp-gmailcal
```

#### Running in Read-Only Environments (e.g., Claude)
When running in read-only environments like Claude AI, use the `--memory-only` flag to prevent file system writes:
```bash
cargo run -- --memory-only
# or
./target/release/mcp-gmailcal --memory-only
```

This will use in-memory logging (via stderr) instead of attempting to write log files to disk.

### 5. Configure Claude to Use the MCP Server
1. Add the MCP server via Claude Code CLI:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add
   ```
2. Follow prompts to integrate your Gmail MCP server.

### 🛠 Usage in Claude
You can directly use tools through commands like:

#### Email Commands
```
/tool list_emails max_results=5

## 📝 Advanced Email Analysis

The Gmail MCP Server provides specialized analysis capabilities through a set of custom prompts that help Claude understand and extract insights from emails:

### Analysis Types
- **General Email Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of email content, context, tone, and next steps
- **Task Extraction**: Identifies explicit and implicit action items, deadlines, and responsibilities
- **Meeting Detection**: Extracts meeting details including date, time, location, participants, and agenda items
- **Contact Extraction**: Identifies and formats contact information from email content
- **Email Summarization**: Creates concise summaries of emails based on their length and complexity
- **Email Categorization**: Classifies emails into categories like Action Required, FYI, Follow-up, etc.
- **Email Prioritization**: Assesses urgency and importance of emails for better inbox management
- **Email Drafting Assistance**: Guidelines for writing effective emails for different purposes

### Using Analysis Features
- Individual analysis: `analyze_email message_id="..." analysis_type="tasks|meetings|contacts|summary|priority|all"`
- Batch analysis: `batch_analyze_emails message_ids=["id1", "id2", "id3"] analysis_type="summary"`

These analysis features help users quickly understand email content, extract important information, and take appropriate actions without having to read through lengthy messages.

- **List Events**: Get events from any calendar with optional filtering by date range
- **Get Event Details**: Retrieve complete information about a specific event
- **Create Events**: Schedule new events with titles, descriptions, times, locations, and attendees

### Calendar Permissions
The Calendar API uses the same OAuth credentials as the Gmail API, but requires the following additional scopes:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` (for reading calendars and events)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` (for creating and modifying events)

You can modify your OAuth consent screen to include these scopes when setting up your Google Cloud project.

## 👤 Contact Management

The Google People API integration provides tools to access and search your contacts:

### Contact Features
- **List Contacts**: View all contacts in your Google Contacts with optional limit
- **Search Contacts**: Find contacts by name, email, organization or other attributes
- **Get Contact Details**: Retrieve complete information about a specific contact including name, emails, phone numbers, and organizations

### Contact Permissions
The People API uses the same OAuth credentials as the Gmail API, but requires the following additional scope:
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly` (for reading contact information)

This scope gives read-only access to your contacts, allowing the MCP server to retrieve contact information without modifying your contact list.
