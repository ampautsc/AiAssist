## 2026-01-17 - Initial System Architecture

**Context**: Creating the foundational infrastructure for a personal AI assistant that learns and improves over time.

**Action**: Designed a comprehensive system with:
- Agent instructions for continuous learning
- Task tracking for persistence across conversations
- Documentation system for knowledge retention
- Skills library for reusable capabilities
- MCP server integration for enhanced functionality

**Result**: Created a modular, extensible architecture that supports:
- Persistent task management
- Continuous learning and documentation
- Both Desktop and Cloud Copilot modes
- Self-improvement loops

**Learning**: AI assistants benefit from:
1. Structured documentation systems
2. Persistent state management
3. Clear operational guidelines
4. Self-improvement protocols
5. Modular, extensible architecture

**Application**: 
- Always check active tasks at conversation start
- Document learnings after each significant task
- Update skills and instructions as patterns emerge
- Maintain task persistence for complex work
- Use structured formats for consistency
