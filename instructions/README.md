## Creating New Instructions

When creating a new instruction document:

1. **Be specific**: Focus on a particular context or scenario
2. **Be actionable**: Provide clear, executable steps
3. **Include examples**: Show don't just tell
4. **Reference related docs**: Link to skills, other instructions
5. **Keep updated**: Instructions should evolve with the system
