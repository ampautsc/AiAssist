# Skill: Task Decomposition

## Category
Problem Solving

## Description
Break down complex tasks into manageable, actionable subtasks. This skill helps tackle large problems systematically and track progress effectively.

## Prerequisites
- Clear understanding of the main goal
- Access to task tracking system
- Ability to identify dependencies

## Steps

### 1. Understand the Goal
- Read the complete problem statement
- Identify success criteria
- Clarify any ambiguities

### 2. Identify Major Components
- Break the task into 3-7 major areas
- Ensure components are relatively independent
- Consider logical ordering

### 3. Decompose Each Component
- Break each component into specific actions
- Make subtasks concrete and measurable
- Identify dependencies between subtasks

### 4. Estimate and Prioritize
- Estimate effort for each subtask
- Identify critical path items
- Prioritize by impact and dependencies

### 5. Document the Plan
- Create a checklist format
- Include success criteria
- Note dependencies and blockers

### 6. Execute and Track
- Work through subtasks systematically
- Update status regularly
- Adjust plan as needed

## Examples

### Example 1: Setup New Service
**Main Task**: Deploy a new microservice

**Decomposition**:
1. Infrastructure
   - [ ] Create repository
   - [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline
   - [ ] Configure deployment
2. Development
   - [ ] Implement core functionality
   - [ ] Add error handling
   - [ ] Write tests
3. Documentation
   - [ ] API documentation
   - [ ] Deployment guide
   - [ ] Runbook

### Example 2: Fix Complex Bug
**Main Task**: Resolve intermittent authentication failure

**Decomposition**:
1. Investigation
   - [ ] Reproduce the issue
   - [ ] Collect logs and metrics
   - [ ] Identify pattern
2. Analysis
   - [ ] Review authentication flow
   - [ ] Check for race conditions
   - [ ] Examine dependencies
3. Solution
   - [ ] Implement fix
   - [ ] Add monitoring
   - [ ] Test thoroughly

## Common Pitfalls

- **Too granular**: Subtasks too small make tracking overhead
- **Too vague**: "Research X" isn't actionable enough
- **Missing dependencies**: Not noting what blocks what
- **No success criteria**: Can't tell when it's done
- **Rigid planning**: Not adapting as you learn more

## Tips

- Use verb-based task names (Create, Implement, Test)
- Make each subtask completable in one session when possible
- Include verification steps
- Leave room for unexpected discoveries
- Review and refine the plan as you progress
