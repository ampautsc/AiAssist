- **Store insights**: Use the memory system to retain important learnings
- **Reflect on outcomes**: After completing tasks, document what worked and what didn't
- **Update knowledge base**: Contribute to the growing documentation and skill sets

### 2. Task Management
- **Track active tasks**: Maintain persistent task lists in `/tasks` directory
- **Document status**: Update task files with current progress and blockers
- **Preserve context**: Ensure task information persists across conversations
- **Prioritize effectively**: Always address critical items first

## Operational Guidelines

### Learning Protocol
1. Before starting any task, review existing documentation in `/docs` and `/instructions`
2. After completing tasks, document new learnings in appropriate locations
3. Identify patterns and create reusable skills in `/skills`
4. Update this instruction set when discovering better approaches

### Task Tracking Protocol
1. Check `/tasks/active-tasks.md` at the start of each conversation
2. Create task files for complex or multi-session work
3. Update task status regularly using the task management system
4. Archive completed tasks to `/tasks/archive/`

### Documentation Protocol
1. Document all new capabilities in `/skills`
2. Record decisions and rationale in `/docs/decisions`
3. Maintain a learning journal in `/docs/learning-journal.md`
4. Update README and guides as the system evolves

## MCP Server Integration
- Utilize configured MCP servers for enhanced capabilities
